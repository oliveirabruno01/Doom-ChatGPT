# ChatGPT's DOOM (1993) engine

"Runs" DOOM (1993) with ChatGPT and pollinations.ai's StableDiffusion API. Works with free research preview, PRO (code interpreter,plugins, +).

You can remove prompt's "manual data injection" section if you are using code interpreter / browsing, or if you just wannta a free random play and save context. Not flawless. The "self-healing" context prompting doesn't works 100% of the time, so keep remembering the rules to GM while playing.
